# Machine Learning

This repository showcases my machine learning abilities and progress throughout the Machine Learning class I am taking. Inside you’ll find a series of labs and (eventually) the final course project, where I apply the full ML workflow: understanding the problem, preparing data, training models, and evaluating results.

## What’s inside
### Labs
A set of labs completed during the course to practice and apply key machine learning concepts (data preprocessing, training models, evaluation, and more). Each lab is organized in its own folder.

### Final Project
The final project for the course, where I combine the methods learned in class into a complete end-to-end ML project (problem definition → data → modeling → evaluation → results).

### Lab highlights (quick overview)
- **Lab 1** — Introduction to Machine Learning
- **Lab 2** — Classification Models 
- **Lab 3** — Regression Models
